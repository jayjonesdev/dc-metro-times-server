## About The App
DC Metro Times is an app that allows you to view the schedules of buses and trains in Washington, DC.

## Technologies
- Node
- Express
- TypeScript
- Axios
- Jest

## Setup
- download/clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file with these variables in it:
    - `FRONTEND_URL`: This is the URL of your client application (download/clone [dc-metro-times-web](https://github.com/jayjonesdev/dc-metro-times-web))
    - `WMATA_API_HOST`: WMATA API Host
    - `WMATA_API_KEY`: WMATA Developer API Key -- this can be generated by creating a [WMATA developer account](https://developer.wmata.com)
- Start the server by running `npm run dev` 

## Approach
I wanted to create a server that processes different transit events, fetching train/bus schedules and incidents, and emits them using socket.io. 

## Status
Currently only the train schedules are being fetched, eventually the bus schedule will be integrated as well.
